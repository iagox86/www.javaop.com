<p class="sectionbody">JavaOp is a cross-platform, flexible, plugin-oriented Battle.net Binary Bot.</p>

<p class="sectionbody">It is currently being developed mainly by Ron, based originally on the 
code for <a href="http://www.valhallalegends.com/iago/bots/jbbot-final.tgz">JBBot</a>.  Currently on the second
major revision, using a bot based on Java for Battle.net is unprecidented, and graciously accepted by
many members of the Battle.net community.  It is being actively developed and tested, and all code from
it is considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">Public Domain</a>.  Feel free to
<a href="mailto:ronjavaop@javaop.com">Email me</a> or post on my 
<a href="https://www.x86labs.org/forum/index.php?board=13.0">forum</a> if you wish to contact me, or
have a look at other pages on this site for more information.

I guess I should start by saying that I'm still alive, and I still check my email every day (although the @valhallalegends.com address is dead, use the one above). The forum still exists, too, and JavaOp2 should still work on Battle.net. That being said, the current version (beta42), which can now be found on the <a href="download.html">Download Page</a>, relies on BNLS for version checking, which is unfortunate. At some point, I might update JavaOp2 so that it can work with local hashing again. Thanks to everybody who still uses it and to anybody who's contributed to it!

Released the very first beta version of JavaOp2.  It doesn't have much functionality yet,
but if you're interested in helping me out, you can download it from the 
<a href="download.html">Download Page</a>.
