<p class="sectionheader"> Download </p>

<p class="sectionbody">
The first thing you need to do is <a href="download.html">download</a> the latest core and plugins.  
They can be unzipped to seperate folders, and it doesn't matter where they are.  Once they're unzipped, 
you should have a bunch of .jar files.  
</p>



<p class="sectionheader"> Running .jar Files </p>

<p class="sectionbody">
If Java is installed properly, you should be able to double-click the core .jar files to bring up the 
configuration and plugin management.  If you find that .jar files are associated with WinRar, open up
WinRar and go into the configuration.  Find the "associations" page and unclick ".jar".  If you still
can't double-click .jar files, you probably need to install Java.  For more information, see 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp">Sun's Download Page</a>, and get the 
"J2SE 1.5.0 JRE".  Once that's installed, you should be able to double-click the .jar files to run them.
If you wish to run the .jar files off a commandline, on any platform, use the command 
"java -jar Jarfile.jar".  
</p>


<p class="sectionheader">Starting the bot</p>

<p class="sectionbody">
<i>Note: this tutorial was written for JavaOp2 beta 26.  It should still apply to newer versions.  It does
NOT apply to older versions.</i>
</p>

<p class="sectionbody">
Double click JavaOp2.jar to run it.  You will likely be prompted to find the plugins:<br>
<img src="images/started1.jpg" alt="started1.jpg"><br>
</p>

<p class="sectionbody">
Press "Ok", and find the folder where you extracted the plugins to:<br>
<img src="images/started2.jpg" alt="started2.jpg"><br>
</p>

<p class="sectionbody">
You'll then be presented with a blank bot:<br>
<img src="images/started3.jpg" alt="started3.jpg"><br>
</p>

<p class="sectionbody">
Under the "File" menu, choose "New bot..."  (or press control-n):
<img src="images/started4.jpg" alt="started4.jpg"><br>  
</p>

<p class="sectionbody">
You'll be prompted for a name.  Give it one:<br>
<img src="images/started5.jpg" alt="started5.jpg"><br>
</p>

<p class="sectionbody">
The bot should load up and give you a Warning:
<img src="images/started6.jpg" alt="started6.jpg"><br>
</p>

<p class="sectionbody">
Next, you have to fill in your account information.  
Under the "settings" menu, choose "configure" (or press control-f).  When the settings come up, in the
left column, click on "Battle.net Login Plugin."  Fill in your username, password, and cdkey, and choose which
game client you want to use to connect:<br>
<img src="images/started7.jpg" alt="started7.jpg"><br>
</p>

<p class="sectionbody">
You can change other settings or add plugins if you'd like.  Generally, the default settings aren't too bad.
When you're done all that, close the settings and make sure you save.  Then, under the "Connection" menu,
click "Connect":

</p>



<p class="sectionheader">The Files</p>

<p class="sectionbody">
In this section, I'm going to explain the various files, their format, and what they are used for.  If
you are working through a shell with no graphical interface, you will need to edit these by hand.  Or 
if you just don't like gui utilities.  When you see a file like <i>&lt;botname&gt;</i>.jbb, replace 
<i>&lt;botname&gt;</i> with the name of the bot, such as mybot.jbb.  All files are located in your home 
folder, in a directory called ".javaop2".  On Linux, this would be "/home/<i>&lt;username</i>&gt;/.javaop2/", and on 
Windows it would be "C:\Documents and Settings<i>\&lt;username&gt;</i>\.javaop2\".  The reason for this is that it 
lets you move the bot, or reinstall the bot, or let seperate users use the bot without having to share 
your data files.

<ul>
	<li><b>_PluginPaths.txt</b> -- The path or list of paths that is searched for plugins (.jar files).  This
		contains one plugin/line, and it can be a file, a folder, or a url.  Modified by 
		SelectPlugins.jar.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>_DefaultBots.txt</b> -- The list of bots that will be loaded by default (if none are specified on 
		the commandline).  There is one bot/line.  This is modified by SetupBots.jar.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>_GlobalSettings.txt</b> -- The global plugins that affect all bots.  Currently, I don't use it for
		anything, but it's still generated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b><i>&lt;botname&gt;</i>.jbb</b> -- This is the settings file for the bot.  It is divided into sections based
		on the plugins.  Each plugin's section is name=value pairs.  This should be automatically 
		generated the first time you run the bot, with default values.  It can be edited with SetupBots.jar.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b><i>&lt;botname&gt;</i>.jdb</b> -- This is the user database file.  It is a series of username=FLAGS pairs, 
		where flags has to be in uppercase.  The names aren't case sensitive, and can include wildcards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b><i>&lt;botname&gt;</i>.plugin</b> -- This is the list of plugins that are loaded by the bot when it starts.
		This is modified by SetupBots.jar.  One plugin/line.</li>
</ul>
